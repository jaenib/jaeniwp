Design decisions for jaenib.com/cv

Palette
- Red-orange accent: #d84a2b
- Dark aubergine: #2a0f31
- Grey-violet: #6f6277
- Dark base: background #0b0a0f, panel #14111a, line #2b2433

Form and layout
- Dark mode as default; use red-orange and muted violet glows sparingly to avoid heavy neon.
- All UI boxes are sharp-edged (no rounded corners) across panels, cards, chips, buttons, and nav.
- Sticky left rail with nav anchors; main content in stacked panels.
- Subtle background grid on a flat dark base (no background gradients).
- Panels and cards behave like thin glass sheets: translucent fills, faint borders, soft drop shadows, and blur.
- Portfolio structure: short "Selected Works" panel + a single deep case study + tooling summary.
- Current hierarchy: Portfolio overview (downloads) + three deep case studies (Familiar Stranger, Binz/B2Morrow, Sensing Abundance) + compact index of remaining works.
- New subpages: Dream Together and Invisibility live under `cv/projects/` with the same visual system.
- Links section collects official destinations for collaborations, socials, and media channels.

Typography
- Space Grotesk for headings, General Sans for body.
- Lead paragraph slightly darker than muted text for readability.

Content policy
- Do not publish street address or phone number.
- Use jan.ba.jb@gmail.com as the public contact email until changed.
- Keep the PDF download sanitized and aligned with on-page content.
- Portfolio media lives in `cv/assets` and should be optimized for web display.
- Embed only short, optimized video clips (mp4, muted by default, small size).

Future instructions
- Do not add an accent switcher; the palette should be featured in the layout itself.
- If new sections are added, keep the visual rhythm: short header + dense content blocks.
- Avoid overly rounded shapes or pastel schemes; keep the tone precise and architectural.
