Form and layout
- All UI boxes are sharp-edged (no rounded corners) across panels, cards, chips, buttons, and nav.
- Sticky left rail with nav anchors; main content in stacked panels.
- Subtle radial background haze using the palette (no heavy gradients).

Typography
- Space Grotesk for headings, General Sans for body.
- Lead paragraph slightly darker than muted text for readability.

Content policy
- Do not publish street address or phone number.
- Use jan.ba.jb@gmail.com as the public contact email until changed.
- Keep the PDF download sanitized and aligned with on-page content.

Future instructions
- Keep the accent switcher limited to the approved palette colors.
- If new sections are added, keep the visual rhythm: short header + dense content blocks.
- Avoid overly rounded shapes or pastel schemes; keep the tone precise and architectural.
